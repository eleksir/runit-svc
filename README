svc - runit sv replacement utility.

Svc was created because of there is no mean to manage services, running under
runsvdir from user. Despite of docs runit native utility disregard environment
variable SVDIR when looking for service, so all services MUST be in /service
dir which is not user writable.

Also sv is unable to list, enable, disable and restart services.

There is sample config file for user services, it is located in doc/examples.
It should be placed in ~/.local/etc directory of non-root user.

For system-wide services there is no config file required.

Requirements: perl, perl-JSON-PP (both already supplied with slackware linux)
